<p>Locus of control is the degree to which people believe that they have control over the outcome of events in their lives. Locus of control can influence not only how you respond to the events that happen in your life, but also your motivation to take action. If you believe that you hold the keys to your fate, you are more likely to take action to change your situation when needed. If on the other hand, you believe that the outcome is out of your hands, you may be less likely to work toward change.

<p>Self-awareness skills, as the term indicates, refer to one’s ability to be aware of or to recognize one’s own emotions, behaviors, beliefs, motivations and other characteristics such as strengths and weaknesses, such that it enables us to identify and understand ourselves as a separate entity. Self-awareness is important because when we have a better understanding of ourselves, we can experience ourselves as unique and separate individuals. We are then empowered to make changes and to build on our areas of strength as well as identify areas where we would like to make improvements. Having self-awareness skills not only enables you to understand your own personality but also helps you comprehend other people, their perceptions about you, and your response to their actions. Apart from enabling you to understand, it also helps you to change your own thoughts and interpretations, in an effort to alter some unwarranted emotions.
