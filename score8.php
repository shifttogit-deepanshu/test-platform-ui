<p>Office managers oversee everyday operations, which can involve many different staff members. Office managers need to know how to handle several things at once without compromising effectiveness or efficiency. Office managers perform many tasks with responsibilities that range from ordering office supplies to following up on customer complaints. They often act as the glue that holds the other departments together as they shuttle from one part of the office to the other, depositing issues into the proper hands and picking up problems to be solved.
