<p>Visual memory is a form of memory which preserves some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. It is the ability to remember or recall information such as activities, pictures or words that have been viewed in the past. The more carefully you observe, the better you will remember; thus, visual memory is found to play a crucial role in learning and performance.

<p>Individuals who are good kinesthetic learners are more efficient when they participate in physical activities like science experiments, sports or even dancing. As a kinesthetic learner, individuals lean more towards tactile learning than bodily learning. Tactile learners prefer to use touch, rather than by body movement. When kinesthetic learners must learn by listening or reading, they often like to move something with their hands to satisfy their tactile instincts.

<p>Numeracy reasoning skills can be thought of as the application of analysis, inference, interpretation, explanation, evaluation, as well as reflection on one’s own reasoning process (metacognition) to numerical and spatial information and relationship. Numerical reasoning is one of the most basic skills needed in today’s data-driven marketplace, and without strong numerical reasoning skills, it would be difficult to succeed in many jobs today. Many fields benefit from this type of testing, including most clerical and administrative jobs, jobs found in the craft and technical field at any level, and even positions in police or fire departments, or in the military field.

<p>It is the capacity to understand, reason, and remember the spatial relations among objects or space. Visual-spatial abilities are used for everyday use from navigation, understanding or fixing equipment, understanding or estimating distance and measurement, and performing on a job. Spatial intelligence involves understanding and remembering the relative locations of objects in the mind. Objects can be manipulated through mental movement or transformation. It is the ability to perform visualization and spatial thinking.
