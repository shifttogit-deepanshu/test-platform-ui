<p>Cognitive flexibility is the ability to revise your plans in the face of obstacles, setbacks, new information, or mistakes. Essentially, it is your ability to adapt when a situation changes. Having cognitive flexibility allows you to analyze a situation and come up with alternative plans to meet your goals or requirements. It’s important to possess this skill so you don’t end up frozen in a situation where you can’t move forward to your next task. Being cognitively flexible increases your likelihood of success, too. This ability to quickly adapt to new situations increases one’s brain function and resilience to stress. Cognitively flexible people tend to have increased fluency and comprehension while reading and they have an expanded sense of awareness. Being cognitively flexible allows you to see different points of view with empathy and understanding, which is a particularly important skill in today’s diverse society.
